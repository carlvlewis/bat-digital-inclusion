## Equity as core to the mission of 'civic-technology' communities

If a public process, service, or system doesn't work for all users, _**it doesn't work.**_ If a democratic government represented by an engaged and informed public ignores the needs of any one group of people, it ignores its own creed. For government to work for the people, by the people, of the people, it must work for all people, not just those with the money or time to participate in exclusionary systems.
