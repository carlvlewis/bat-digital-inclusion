## If it isn't equitable, it doesn't work.

If a public process, service, or system doesn't work for _all_ users, _**it doesn't work.**_ If a democratic government elected by an engaged and informed public systematically devalues or ignores the needs of any one group of people, it ignores the very basis of democracy upon which it is built. **For government to work** _**for**_ **the people,** _**by**_ **the people, and** _**of**_ **the people, it must work for** _**all**_ **people, not just those with the money or time to participate in exclusionary systems.** 

Nothing about this is particularly new or unique to today's technologically-powered, globally-interconnected society;  exclusionary public sector policies and private sector norms have since the beginnings of Western Democracy undermined the very political system they claim to represent â€“ from Jim Crow laws in the early 20th century and, more recently, residential segregation by geography in the last three decades, to the Defense of Marriage Act in the 1990s and the continued cultural preference for  heteronormativity in pop culture to this day.



. For nearly the entirety of Western Democracy's relatively-short history, exclusionary political systems, hierarchical class divisions, and s social structures have hampered the efficiency, equity, 

In the early days of the Web and even in the early days of the civic-tech movement not too long ago, it was regarded as basic logic that the 'open, interconnected, permissionless nature of participatory media and a networked information era' would be a harbinger of greater democracy, leveling the inequities in 

 equity, civic innovation

Equality isn't equity



Civic tech \*must\* figure out IDEA; cannot exclude anyone.
