## If it isn't equitable, it doesn't work.

If a public process, service, or system doesn't work for _all_ users, _**it doesn't work.**_ If a democratic government systematically devalues or ignores the needs of any one group of people, it ignores the very basis of democracy upon which it is built. **For government to work** _**for**_ **the people,** _**by**_ **the people, and** _**of**_ **the people, it must work for** _**all**_ **people, not just those with the money, power, or the extra time to participate in exclusionary systems.** 

Nothing about this is new or unique to today's technologically-driven world. Exclusionary government policy empowered by private sector prejudice has long plagued U.S. Democracy  â€“ from Jim Crow laws in the early 20th century to the Defense of Marriage Act in the 1990s.

 Exclusion, whether tacit or explicit, undermines the very supposedly equitable political system in which it operates. When we leave out or don't do enough to compensate for systemic power imbalances, we fail to live up to the ideal of "government by the people, for the people, of the people" on which our nation was founded.



In the early days of the Web and even in the early days of the civic-tech movement not too long ago, it was regarded as basic logic that the 'open, interconnected, permissionless nature of participatory media and a networked information era' would be a harbinger of greater democracy, leveling the inequities in 

 equity, civic innovation

Equality isn't equity



Civic tech \*must\* figure out IDEA; cannot exclude anyone.
