# Purpose of this Brigade Action Team \(BAT\) Guide

## Making inclusion and digital equity projects a core part of Brigades' work in the communities they serve

### 1. To lay the groundwork and align resources for a structured toolkit for IDEA efforts; creating shared metrics for progress

CfA's Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility \(_**IDEA**_\) Brigade Action Team \(BAT\) is the first organized and structured inter-brigade effort to exchange knowledge and resources to develop a shared framework for IDEA efforts across the brigade network. This collective effort should result in the creation of a DEI Toolkit that is open-sourced, reproducible, and shared with all brigade members, and adaptable by the constituents they serve, and other organizations.



The scope of the BAT is to align efforts and resources and create an action plan that identifies IDEA BAT projects that all participating brigades can work on and a framework that can be deployed successfully for any brigade project process. This action plan will also create timelines and milestones so that all success criteria \(metrics\) are completed. Our proposed timeline for this scope is eight months.

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
